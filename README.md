# *Brooklyn Nine-Nine (TV Series)*
Captain Ray Holt takes over Brooklyn's 99th precinct, including Detective Jake Peralta, a talented but carefree detective used to doing whatever he wants. The other employees of the 99th precinct include Detective Amy Santiago, Jake's over-achieving and competitive partner; Detective Rosa Diaz, a tough and kept-to-herself coworker; Detective Charles Boyle, Jake's best friend who also has a crush on Rosa; Detective Sergeant Terry Jeffords, who was recently taken off the field after the birth of his twin girls; and Gina Linetti, the precinct's sarcastic administrator.

# *Did you know*
**Trivia**
: Andy Samberg (Peralta) and Chelsea Peretti (Linetti) went to the same elementary school, just as their characters had in the series.

**Goofs**
: Holt carries a revolver rather than a semiautomatic like Jake, Rosa, Amy, Charles, and Terry do because the NYPD allowed any officer who purchased a revolver before the department's switchover to semiautomatics in 1994--such as Holt, who had been with the department since the 1970s--to keep them.

**Quotes**
: [repeated lines] Terry Jeffords: *Nine-nine!*
